# Pygame Widgets and Helpers Tutorial

This repository is designed as a brief tutorial to help you get started with `pygwidgets` and `pyghelpers`, two libraries that extend the capabilities of Pygame for creating user interfaces and managing game states more effectively. The tutorials and code samples provided here aim to offer a practical introduction to these libraries, making it easier to incorporate UI elements into your Pygame projects and manage different aspects of your game's lifecycle.

## Description

The content within this repository includes various examples and exercises that demonstrate how to use `pygwidgets` and `pyghelpers` for building more interactive and user-friendly Pygame applications. `pygwidgets` offers a wide range of widgets, such as buttons, sliders, and text inputs, that can be easily integrated into your games. On the other hand, `pyghelpers` provides a framework to manage game states, transitions, and scenes, facilitating a more organized and modular approach to game development.

Some of the code examples and tutorials in this repository are based on the original work by Irv Kalb. His contributions to the Pygame community through these libraries have made it significantly easier to create polished and complete game projects. The examples provided here are adapted and expanded upon for educational purposes and to facilitate learning within our capstone project group.

## Purpose

This repository serves solely for educational purposes and as a resource for my capstone project group. It is intended to share knowledge and foster learning among group members, allowing us to explore the capabilities of `pygwidgets` and `pyghelpers` in a collaborative environment.
